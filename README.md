# pivot
Pivot Project (name taken from the file name)  

These files were given to me by a friend, i only helped him make this static page be downloadable so he can use it like an app in his mobile. Basically i do not know what pivot does, i just copied/converted pivot to index and added  
1.manifest.json  
2.service-worker.js  

These files just help the app to make it installable from chrome/browser to your desktop or mobile.  

  Note: If you want to peek into what is inside index, take a look.
